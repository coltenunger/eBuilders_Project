Title: eBuilders Project

Description: This flask run app is a way to keep track of projects, managers and clients for a construction company. Simple as that.

ENDPOINTS: I used GET, POST and DELETE. I would like to implement a POST for projects and clients and possibly a PUT for all of these tables as well.


I started with a lot more tables (subs and vendors tables) but that was a LOT of data to input in such a short time. I'm working on designing the app to have these tables as well. I chose an ORM approach because I didn't understand it very well and wanted to work with it more so that I could learn it at a deeper level. 
In addition to POST and PUT endpoints for very table, I would like to add Subs and Vendors tables so that Projects Managers can keep track of which sub-contractor's and vendor's materials they are using on each respective project.
